# Impossible Trivia
## Project for the course Programming 1

Welcome to Impossible Trivia, a game born from my first Programming class adventure! This program showcases the skills and concepts acquired throughout my semester 1, including the application of arrays, do-while loops, switch statements, and handling keyboard inputs.

## Game Overview 
Impossible Trivia is not your ordinary trivia game; it's a unique fusion of trivia and a 'chasing' game. Players face questions, and the challenge lies in chasing down the correct letter of their answer using the arrow keys.

## Launch the game
1. Download the Game: Simply grab the .zip file and unzip it to access the program.
2. Run the Program: Execute the program to dive into the world of Impossible Trivia.

## How to play
1. Read the question and the multiple choice.
2. When you are ready to answer, press any arrow key to make the player icon ($) appear on the grid.
3. Using the arrow keys to move around, chase the letter of your answer.

## Tips
1. There is not time limit, so take your time :)
2. Actively move your icon around because the letters can generate where you are and therefore saving that letter as the answer even though that was not your choice. So be careful!!
